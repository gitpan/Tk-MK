0.20 Sun Nov  8 16:15:12 CET 2009

	o Completely rewritten Tk::Buttonplus Widget and renamed it to Tk::CompoundButton to honor the fact that it
	  is based on the Tk::Compound methods
	  This rewrite resolves some minor graphical flaws happening at Buttonplus under certain circumstances
	  
	o Fixed a problem in DHList: '-bg'/'-background' did not automatically influence the "data-field-area background"
	  ( A problem for list that change their background dynamically during operation )
	  As a work-around solution '-bg' now will set the main background AND the data-field background, while
	  '-background' changes only the main area BG.
